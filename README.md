## Hello!
### Good morning! I'm Rews!

Hello, my name is Rews, hence @RewsDraws!
</n> I'm still figuring things out, it's tiring, but fun too!<br>
You probably found this website from somewhere, welcome!<br>

Here are lists of my SNS:<br>

## What is "RewsCompilation"?
### What is it?

RewsCompilation, or Rews'Compilation, is any sort of media that features Rews whether it's comics, illustrations, videoworks, or even games - and Rews is me!

That is why you see the magenta-haired-blob appearing on my SNS if you were happened to follow me.
### Can I find more about this?
Absolutely, I update those on my SNS, even though I hadn't done much - I'm figuring this out, no excuse. Or if you wanted to talk, feel free to contact me with your inquirires.
### Is there more question?
To be honest, these are soliloquies, no-one asked me these said questions. I might add more in the future.
For now, thank you for taking your time to visit. See you when another story progress!
